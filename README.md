# Communication-Systems

In this repository, we explore several projects related to telecommunication systems.

# CA1

In this project, we aim to explore the concepts of signals, correlation functions, and spectral density. Additionally, we will become familiar with the concept of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). In the first part, we will diagnose a device by comparing its normal sound profile with the sound it produces after operation, to determine whether the device is functioning properly or is faulty. In the next section, we will develop an equalization system to correct the distortion in the input signal. Finally, we will explore the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
