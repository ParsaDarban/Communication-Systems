# Communication-Systems

In this repository, we explore several projects related to telecommunication systems.

# CA1

In this project, we aim to explore the concepts of signals, correlation functions, and spectral density. Additionally, we will become familiar with the concept of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). In the first part, we will diagnose a device by comparing its normal sound profile with the sound it produces after operation, to determine whether the device is functioning properly or is faulty. In the next section, we will develop an equalization system to correct the distortion in the input signal. Finally, we will explore the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

# CA2
In this project, we will explore amplitude and phase modulation techniques such as AM, DSB, FM, and PM. We will implement these techniques and then demodulate them. Finally, we will examine the conversion of FM modulation to AM modulation.

# CA3
In this project, we will examine statistical distributions in signals. In the first two sections, we will focus on the Rayleigh distribution, which is commonly used in telecommunications, and explore random processes. 
In the final section, we will study MPAM modulation and signal quantization in digital communications.
